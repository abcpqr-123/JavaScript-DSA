// Essential Graph Terms: 

// * Vertex - a node 

// * Edge - connection between nodes 

// * Weigthted/Unweigthed - values assigned to distances between vertices 

// * Directed/Undirected - Directions assigned to distanced between vertices 


// undirected Graph: 

//  The graph in which there is no direction to the connections is known as 
//  Undirected Graph.  It represents 2-way connection
//     If A and B are connections then B and A are also connetions 
//     There will we be direction associated with edge 

// Ex: Facebook Friends Graph 

//     Surya can see the content of Andrew and Andrew can see the content 
//     Of Surya 



// Directed Graph: 

// The graph in which there is a direction assigned to an edge and edge counld 
// be bidirectional or unidirectional i.e It could point both way, but it also 
// could point one way. 

// There is a direction assingned to the edge. 

// Ex: Social notwork model of instagram 
//     Ex: Surya follows Sachin, but Sachin wont follows Surya 



// Weighted Graph: 
// When we assign the values to the edges of the graph it becomes weighted 
// graph. 

// Ex: * Google maps are the example for weighted undirected graph 

//     * Instagram can be the example for both directed and undirected graphs 
    //    For example: Instagram tracks of who follows and who watches the content 
    //                 of a celebrity the most 



// UnWeighted Graph: 

// Ex:    * Instagram followers Graph is a UnWeighted directed Graph
        
//        * Facebook Friends graph is UnWeighted Undirected Graph
