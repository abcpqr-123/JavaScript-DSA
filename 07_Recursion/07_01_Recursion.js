// Recursion in normal words: 
//            Tacking one problem and doing it over and over again on smaller a
//            piece or on a chainging piece, until we hit some end point, which is 
//            also known as the base case.


// what is recursion?
// A process (a function in our case) that calls itself


// How recursive function works?
// Invoke the same function with a different input util u 
// reach your base case.


// Base Case:
// The codition when the recursion ends.
