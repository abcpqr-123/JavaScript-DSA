// mergeSort Pseudocode:


// * Break up the array into halves until u have arrays that are 
//   empty or have one element 
// * Once u have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with  
//   other sorted arrays until u are back at the full length of the 
//   array 
// * Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged 
//   (and sorted!) arrays
