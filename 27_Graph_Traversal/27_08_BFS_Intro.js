// BREADTH FIRST 

// * This function should accept a starting vertex 

// * Create a queue (u can use an array) and place the sarting vertex in it 
  
// * Create an array to store the nodes cisited 

// * Create an object to store nodes visited 

// * Mark the starting vertex as visited 

// * Loop as long s there is anything in the queue 

// * Remove the first vertex from the queue and push it into the array that 
//   stores nodes visited 

// * Loop over each vertex in the adjacency list for the vertex u r visiting 

// * If it is not inside the obhect that stores nodes visited, mark it as visited 
//   and enqueue that vertex 

// * Once u have finished looping, return the array of visited nodes
