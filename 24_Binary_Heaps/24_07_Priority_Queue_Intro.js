// What is a Priority queue? 

// A data structure where each Element with higher priorities are 
// served before elements with lower proprities


// A naive version: 
// Use a list to store all elements 

// Priority: 3   Prority: 1   Priority: 2   Prority: 5   Prority: 4

// iterate over the entire thing to find the highest priority element
