// Recap: 

// * Trees are non-linear data structure that contain a root and 
//   child nodes 

// * Binary Trees can have values of any type, but at most two children 
//   for each parent 

// * Binary Search Trees are a more specific version of Binary Search 
//   Trees Where every node to the left of a parent is less than its 
//   value and every node to the right is greater 

// * We Can Search through Trees using BFS and DFS 

// * In-DFS there are mainly three types: 
  
//     # InOrder 

//     # PreOrder 
     
//     # PostOrder
