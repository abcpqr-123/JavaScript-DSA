// Inserting a node: 

// Steps - Iteratively Or Recusively 

// * Create a new node 

// * Starting at the root 

//   * Check if there is a root, If not-the root now becomes that new Node! 
//   * If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is greater than or 
//     less than the value of the root 

//     * If it is greater 
//       # Check to see if there is a node to the right 
//       # If there is not, add that node as the right property 

//     * If it is less 
//       # If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps 
//       # If there is not, add that node as the rigtht property
