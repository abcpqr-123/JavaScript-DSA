// Finding a node in a BST 

// steps - Iteratively or Recursively 

// * Starting at the root 

//   # Check if threre is a root, If not-we're done Searching! 

//   # If threre is a root, check if the value of the new node is 
//     the value we are looking for, 
//     If we found, we are done! 

//   # If not, check to see if hte value is greater than the value 
//     of the root 
//   # if it is greater 

//     * check to see if there is a node to the right 
    
//         # If there is, move to theat node and repeat these steps 
//         # If there is not, We're done with searching 

//    # If it is less 

//      * check to see if there is a node to the left 
   
//         # If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps 
//         # If there is not, we're done with searching!
